# Deseq2_RNA_seq

The two DE genes anaysis presented in this repository were done in RStudio.
Consult the following link for more information about the DESeq2 Package:

In this document there are some links to tutorials that I recommend and find very useful to learn this package. 
Also they help us to learn how to do differentially expressed genes analysis.
Furthermore, it has some additional details that I found important and are not detailed in the DESeq2 vignette.
